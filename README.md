# IRCNetworking-and-GTK
This was part of an individual project I did for CS240: Programming in C for Spring 2015.  In this repository, I created an IRC Chatroom server.  The server is able to handle creating new rooms, adding users, sending messages, receiving messages, and leaving and joining rooms.  I also made a GTK GUI for this server which is seen in my other repository.
