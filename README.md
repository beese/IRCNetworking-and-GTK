# CS 240 Project: IRC Client GUI
This was part of an individual project I did for CS240: Programming in C for Spring 2015.  In this repository, I created a GUI using GTK to create an interactive chatroom experience.  The GUI includes a sign in window, a way to easily switch between chatrooms and send messages and see the users in the room and all of the room names updated every 5 seconds.
